# Base-SubAccount-Demo

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of SubAccounts on the Base network, a layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. The SubAccount feature allows users to create and manage multiple accounts under a single master account, enabling better organization and management of digital assets.

### Key Features

- Creation and management of sub-accounts
- Secure fund transfers between master and sub-accounts
- Role-based access control for sub-account management
- Integration with Base network's L2 infrastructure
- Gas-efficient operations for cost-effective transactions

### Technology Stack

- Solidity Smart Contracts
- Base Network (L2)
- Hardhat/Foundry Development Environment
- Ethereum Web3 Libraries

This project serves as a practical example of implementing account abstraction and management features on Base, showcasing the potential for building more complex financial applications on Layer 2 solutions.
